* Measuring the muon distribution
** TODO Produce a GDML file containing /just/ the rock
** TODO Run =gevgen_fnal= on it to get interactions in the rock
** TODO Run =edep-sim= on those GENIE files to transport muons out of the rock
- Place a sensitive volume on the edge of the rock (cubical shell)
- Ensure volume is thick enough to record at least one deposit from each muon
** TODO Run script to analyze deposits in that sensitive volume
*** Extract energy, position, elevation, azimuth of each outgoing muon
- Include floor, ceiling, 4 walls

* Sampling the distribution (1 spill)
** Scale total # muons based on POT of this spill vs. POT in dedicated sim above
** Compute fraction from each of the 6 sides
** For each side:
*** Sample position distribution, energy distribution, angle distribution
*** Verify that energy/angle are uncorrelated from position
*** Investigate degree of correlation between energy and angle
*** Consider modeling and fitting these distributions; complexity depends on whether energy and angle are correlated, etc.
** Assign a random time (uniform within the spill?) to each muon
*** Verify that distributions are independent of time since start-of-spill?
*** Otherwise use spill structure histogram?

* Merging rock muons into primary data stream
** Do it at the edep-sim level, before running larnd-sim

* Misc questions
** Cosmic rays
*** How many cosmic muons do we expect in a single spill? How does this compare to the number of rock muons from the beam?
*** If cosmic muons are significant, do we need to run e.g. MUSIC?
